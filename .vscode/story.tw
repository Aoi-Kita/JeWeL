:: Self Made [nobr] {"position":"400,150"}
Exhausted after a long day at work you look down at the stack of JeWeL tickets you bought with the remainder of your paycheck. The drawing was conviently always on the night before you got your next paycheck, so you made a habit out of spending whatever money you had left on tickets. With your wallet now empty you opened up the web page for the drawing to wait for the numbers to be posted.
